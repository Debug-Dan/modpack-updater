<p>--- FAQ ---</p>
<p>Q: Why is the download a .bat file?<br />A: Unlike a traditional application, this launcher runs entirely in the command line. A .bat file is just a script that runs in Command Prompt; this allows the launcher to be extremely lightweight and small in size.</p>
<p>Q: I'm having an issue with something in the launcher. Can you help?<br />A: Yes! The launcher comes with a built-in troubleshooting feature. Just hit option 4 on the main menu.</p>
<p>Q: Is this a virus?<br />A: No. Click <a href="https://debug-dan.github.io/modpack-updater/in-depth.html">here</a> if you want a more in-depth answer.</p>
